## Milestone 2

In this project, we add two overload methods at `src/main/java/org.json/XML.java`. The two method signatures are as
follows, the code starts at `line 751` and ends at `line 905`.
- `public static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, JSONPointer path) throws JSONException`
- `public static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, JSONPointer path, JSONObject replacement) throws JSONException`

The related four JUnit tests we wrote are added at `src/test/java/org.json.junit/XMLTest.java`, 
starting at `line 1069` and ending at `line1185`. The static resource files for testing are at `src/test/resources/`.
All added test cases have been already been verified correctly and the code has passed the CI process on GitHub.

Regarding the time performance, our improvement is when the user would like to query the sub Json object given a specific path,
the function will break and return early once it finishes the whole parsing process of that sub Json object, instead of
continuing until reach the very end of the whole input.

## Milestone 3

In this project, we add two overload methods at `src/main/java/org.json/XML.java`. The method signatures are as
follows, the code starts at `line 909` and ends at `line 963`.
- `public static JSONObject toJSONObject(Reader reader, Function<String, String> keyTransformer)`

The related three JUnit tests we wrote are added at `src/test/java/org.json.junit/XMLTest.java`,
starting at `line 1192` and ending at `line 1258`. The static resource files for testing are at `src/test/resources/*`.
All added test cases have been already been verified correctly.

The function we wrote is to receive a specific string transformer pattern as input from client's code, 
and returns strings transformed as new keys correspondingly.

Regarding the time performance, compared with milestone 1, doing the task inside the library is a `One-Pass` solution,
meaning that the function is able to finish the parsing and transferring process by using only one loop, while the solution
we used in milestone 1 is a classic `Two-Pass` solution.


The building framework we use is `Maven`, so the build script file is `src/pom.xml`.






## Milestone 4

In this section, we add two functions to parse and build the JSONObject as a stream. The method signatures are as follows,
the code is at `src/main/java/org/json/JSONObject.java`, starting at  `line 2730` and ending at `line 2781`.
- `public Stream<Object> toStream()`  given a `JSONObject`, turn it into a stream. Note that we used `StreamBuilder` to create
  the stream, so the return type is `Stream<Object>`. When using it, we need to cast it to `HashMap` firstly.
- `private void streamBuilderHelper(String preKey, Object val)` given the previous path, parse and add each new object
  of the current path into the stream builder recursively.

In our implementation, each element in the stream is a `HashMap<String, Object> Object`, the key is the string
indicating the current path of the value, and the value is the actual object correspondingly. Our function also supports
the parsing of `JSONObject` and `JSONArray` by calling another new function recursively if needed.

The related JUnit tests we wrote are located at `src/test/java/org.json.junit/JSONObjectTest.java`, starting at `line 1192`
and ending at `line 1258`. The static resource files for testing are at `src/test/resources/*`. All added test cases have
already been verified correctly.


The building framework we used is `Maven` and the build script file is located at `src/pom.xml`.

## Milestone 5

In this project, we add a private static class, FutureObject and toJSONObject method at `src/main/java/org.json/XML.java`. The method signatures of class are as
follows, the code starts at `line 970` and ends at `line 998`.
- `public static Future<JSONObject> toJSONObject(Reader reader, Function<String, String> keyTransformer, Consumer<Exception> exceptionHandler) throws Exception`

The related three JUnit tests we wrote are added at `src/test/java/org.json.junit/XMLTest.java`,
starting at `line 1264` and ending at `line 1315`. The static resource files for testing are at `src/test/resources/*`.
All added test cases have been already been verified correctly.

The function, FutureObject class is to construct Future object of JSONObject and with asynchronous call.
Allow the client code to proceed, while specifying what to do when the JSONObject becomes available.


The building framework we use is `Maven`, so the build script file is `src/pom.xml`.

JSON in Java [package org.json]
===============================

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.json/json.svg)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json)

**[Click here if you just want the latest release jar file.](https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/json/json/20211205/json-20211205.jar)**


# Overview

[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/) is a light-weight language-independent data interchange format.

The JSON-Java package is a reference implementation that demonstrates how to parse JSON documents into Java objects and how to generate new JSON documents from the Java classes.

Project goals include:
* Reliable and consistent results
* Adherence to the JSON specification 
* Easy to build, use, and include in other projects
* No external dependencies
* Fast execution and low memory footprint
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Designed and tested to use on Java versions 1.6 - 1.11

The files in this package implement JSON encoders and decoders. The package can also convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL.

The license includes this restriction: ["The software shall be used for good, not evil."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford#%22Good,_not_Evil%22) If your conscience cannot live with that, then choose a different package.

# If you would like to contribute to this project

For more information on contributions, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Bug fixes, code improvements, and unit test coverage changes are welcome! Because this project is currently in the maintenance phase, the kinds of changes that can be accepted are limited. For more information, please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/wiki/FAQ).

# Build Instructions

The org.json package can be built from the command line, Maven, and Gradle. The unit tests can be executed from Maven, Gradle, or individually in an IDE e.g. Eclipse.
 
**Building from the command line**

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*

````
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
````

*Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below)*
````

````

*Test file contents*

````
import org.json.JSONObject;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
       JSONObject jo = new JSONObject("{ \"abc\" : \"def\" }");
       System.out.println(jo.toString());
    }
}
````

*Execute the Test file*
```` 
java -cp .;json-java.jar Test (Windows)
java -cp .:json-java.jar Test (Unix Systems)
